# CanvasCubeWithThreads

# Created by Andreea Onofriesei

 A 3D Cube designed using HTML Canvas while the draw actions are being dispatched by web workers. The project architecture has been developed using MVC pattern & Publisher/Subscriber pattern.
 
 Technologies used : HTML5, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.
 
 How to compile and run the project: open 'index.html' file in your web browser. If you are using Chrome, since it does not allow to run web workers I recommend you this app : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb/related?hl=en . You can easily create a local web server to run the project by only selecting your destination folder. After that the project runs just by clicking the "START" / "STOP" buttons.
